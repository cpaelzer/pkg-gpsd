Description: Global Positioning System - daemon
 The gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more GPS devices connected to
 a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
 sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947.
 .
 With gpsd, multiple GPS client applications can share access to devices
 without contention or loss of data. Also, gpsd responds to queries with a
 format that is substantially easier to parse than the different standards
 emitted by GPS devices.

Description: Global Positioning System - debugging symbols
 The gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more GPS devices connected to
 a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
 sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947.

Description: Global Positioning System - Python libraries
 The gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more GPS devices connected to
 a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
 sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947.
 .
 This package contains a Python interface to connect to gpsd, together with
 a module providing a controlled testing environment. It also ships two tools
 which utilize the interface: gpsprof for latency-profiling, and gpsfake to
 simulate a GPS by playing back a logfile.

Description: Global Positioning System - library
 The gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more GPS devices connected to
 a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
 sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947.
 .
 This package provides libgps, a C service library for querying GPS
 devices. It supports both a low-level interface, which communicates
 directly with the device to which the GPS is connected, and a high-level
 interface, which goes through gpsd and is intended for concurrent use by
 several applications.

Description: Global Positioning System - development files
 The gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more GPS devices connected to
 a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
 sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947.
 .
 This package contains the header and development files needed to build
 programs and packages using libgps.

Description: Global Positioning System - Qt wrapper for libgps
 The gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more GPS devices connected to
 a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
 sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947.
 .
 This package provides libQgpsmm, the Qt version of libgpsmm.
 It is a wrapper over libgps, the service library for querying GPS
 devices. libQgpsmm is available on all platforms which are supported
 by Qt4.
